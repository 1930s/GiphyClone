# GiphyClone
So I've been hearing a lot of hype around Vue.js recently and decided to see what it was all about. With the help of the awesome Giphy API (it has seriously everything you could want) I built a Giphy clone that let's you both see trending GIFs and search GIFs by keyword. Personally, the biggest takeaway was how cool Vue's reactivity feature is. It makes state management super intutive.  
  
Check out a screenshot from the app and feel free to clone it and run:  
```bash
cd project  
npm run dev
 ```
